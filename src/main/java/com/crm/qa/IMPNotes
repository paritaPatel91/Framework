* how to create html report :(Intelli-j idea)
for this method we have to follow atin's concept.

-- go to termianl after creating testcases

-- then run mvn test in the terminal

-- then compilation should be done with build pass

-- then it will generate surefile-reports wait for 2 mins then go to index.html,
and open with browser ,you will see html report over there,
but if compilation failed then it will not generate report.

--I have noticed if i have create directory resources and put file testng.xml and
 then run mvn test then build got failed.

-- sometimes if we have correct x-path but still,It shows unable to locate the element,
then right click and go to view page source and check there is sometimes frame mainpanel and firstpanel select any one ,
most of the time we can select mainpanel.

--In Data driven and page object ,all the classe and their testcases are independant of each other,
not related to each othe.

--@cashlookup --testng::IQ
it will improve the performance of the script ,increase the speed of the browser ,
but use only when they will no change in the coed ,
otherwise cache can crash up the applcation ,and get error mesage to.

** creating ExtentReport
--ExtentReport will come with addition of listerner in the testng.xml file
--Give extact file path there and run testng.xml file
--There will be Extent.html or whatever file name we give it will generate report over there ,
-- right click and run with any browser and we will see complete very nice extent report over there
