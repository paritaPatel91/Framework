* how to create html report :(Intelli-j idea)
for this method we have to follow atin's concept.
-- go to termianl after creating testcases
-- then run mvn test in the terminal
-- then compolation should be done with build pass
-- then it will generate surefile-reports wait for 2 mins then go to index.html,
and open with browser ,you will see html report over there,
but if compilation failed then it will not generate report.
-- sometimes if we have corrct x-path but still,It shows unable to locate the element,
then right click and go to view page source and check there is sometimes frame mainpanel and firstpanel select any one ,
most of the time we can select mainpanel.
--In Data driven and page object ,all the classe and their testcases are independant of each other,
not related to each othe.
